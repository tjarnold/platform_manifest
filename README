This manifest is a modified version from Root-Box.  

I would like to thank the following individuals for their help both directly and indirectly in making it posible for me to build root-box from source.

To start off with, you need to have Ubuntu 13.04, 64-bit installed.  This should work with 12.04+, but I have 13.04 and know that works.  32-bit versions will NOT work.

These commands are all done in terminal.  Make sure you use the commands exactly as tehy are writen.

Next you need to install the correct version of Java by first removing other versions that should not be used.
    sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\* icedtea-\* icedtea6-\*
Now add a self-updating repository.
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
Install Java 6 
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install oracle-java6-installer
    
Just in case you still have another version of Java, we need to make sure your system will use the correct version.
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_35/jre/bin/java 1
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_35/bin/javac 1
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_35/bin/jar 1
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javadoc javadoc /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_35/bin/javadoc 1
Now run the following and ensure that jdk1.6.0_xx is selected for each.
    sudo update-alternatives --config java
    sudo update-alternatives --config javac
    sudo update-alternatives --config jar
    sudo update-alternatives --config javadoc

Now we need to install the stuff needed to build Android.  It is posible some of this stuff may fail, don't worry though, building should still work.
    sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev zlib1g-dev:i386 libc6-dev lib32ncurses5-dev ia32-libs x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev:i386 libreadline6-dev:i386 lib32z-dev libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos python-markdown libxml2-utils xsltproc readline-common libreadline6-dev libreadline6 lib32readline-gplv2-dev libncurses5-dev lib32readline5 lib32readline6 libreadline-dev libreadline6-dev:i386 libreadline6:i386 bzip2 libbz2-dev libbz2-1.0 libghc-bzlib-dev lib32bz2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libesd0-dev squashfs-tools pngcrush schedtool libwxgtk2.8-dev python
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so

Now tell your computer how to "repo"
    mkdir ~/bin
    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
    curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
    
Create a folder for your repos.
    mkdir ~/rootbox_jewel
    cd ~/rootbox_jewel

Sync RootBox_Jewel Sources
    repo init -u https://github.com/tjarnold/platform_manifest.git -b jb-mr1
    repo sync
    
Now its time to build.
    . build_rootbox.sh jewel
